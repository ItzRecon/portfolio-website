            An <b>array</b> stores a fixed number of elements of the same data type. Once you declare an array, the size cannot be changed. Here is an example of initializing an array of integers.
            <br><br>
            <pre>
int numbers[] = {1,2,3,4,5};
            </pre>
            In this example, we initialize an integer array called numbers that contains the 5 integers, <b>1, 2, 3, 4, and 5</b>. You can access each element of an array using its index, which starts at 0. For example, the first element, 1, is at index 0. The second element, 2, is at index 1. You can access the element by using <b>numbers[index]</b>
            <br><br>
            <pre>
int num = numbers[1]; //sets num to 2
            </pre>
            You can also change an element of the array.
            <br><br>
            <pre>
numbers[0] = 2; //changing the first element to 2
            </pre>
            You can also create an array of a size.
            <br><br>
            <pre>
int numbers[] = new numbers[5];
            </pre>
            This array is initialized with default integer values (0).
            <br><br>
            To access each element of an array, we can use a <b>for loop</b> or a <b>foreach</b> loop.
            <br><br>
            <b>For loop</b>
            <pre>
for (int i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) { 
    System.out.println(numbers[i]); 
} 
            </pre>
            <b>Foreach loop</b>
            <pre>
for(int i : numbers) {
  System.out.println(i);
}
            </pre>
            The variable <b>i</b> is used to access each element of array. <b>numbers.length</b> gives us the size of the array, so we use this to determine when to stop. We stop before the size because the index starts at 0, so the last index would be 1 less than the length.
            <br><br>
            Arrays are useful because you can just create 1 array instead of creating many variables. It is also very easy to get elements from an array, using a for loop or using the index.

          <h2 class="text-lg">2D Arrays</h2>
          <div class="2darray text-sm">
              A <b>2D array</b> is an array of arrays. It stores data in the form of a grid. Below is an example of initializing a 2D array of integers.
              <br><br>
              <pre>
int numbers[][] = { {1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6} };
              </pre>
              In this example, we initialize an integer 2D array called numbers that contains the 6 integers, <b>1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6</b>. There are 2 rows and 3 columns. Each row contains 3 numbers. You can access each element of an array using its row and column, which both start at 0. For example, the first element, 1, is at [0][0]. The second element, 2, is at index [0][1]. You can access the element by using <b>numbers[row][column]</b>
              <br><br>
              <pre>
int num = numbers[1][1]; //sets num to 5
              </pre>
              You can also change an element of a 2D array like in a regular array.
              <br><br>
              <pre>
numbers[1][1] = 0; //changes index 1,1 from 5 to 0
              </pre>
              We can also create a 2D array of a size.
              <br><br>
              <pre>
int numbers[][] = new numbers[2][3];
              </pre>
              The array is initialized with default integer values (0). The first perameter specifies the amount of rows, and the second specifies the amount of columns.
              <br><br>
              To iterate through the elements, we can use nested for loops.
              <br><br>
              <pre>
for (int i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) { 
    for (int j = 0; j < numbers[0].length; j++) { 
        System.out.println(numbers[i][j]); 
    } 
} 
              </pre>
              We use the outer for loop to iterate over each row, and the inner for loop iterates over each column. We use the row variable <b>i</b> and the column variable <b>j</b> to access each element and print it.
              <br><br>
              2D arrays are very useful when

            Let's take a look at a project that I used arrays in. In this assignment, I had to compare students to see who was the best overall. I used 1 array to store the names of the students, and another array to store their grades. Arrays made it very easy to store the data for every student. If I didn't use arrays, I would have to create a variable for every name and grade, which would be very tedious. You can see the 2 arrays that I used in my program below.
            <br><br>
            <pre>
public String names[] = new String [35]; //this array stores the name of each student
public int grades[] = new int [35]; //this parallel array stores the corresponding mark of each student
